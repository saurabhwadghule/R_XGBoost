Exploring XGBoost: My First Hands-On Practice with Health Data

"Diving into the world of XGBoost for the first time! In this repository, I'm experimenting with XGBoost using a small practice dataset related to health. The goal is to understand how this powerful algorithm works, from data preprocessing to model evaluation. Follow along as I explore feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and visualization techniquesâ€”all within RStudio.
